Winner of Gravathon 2023, a physics-based coding competition. Built a simulation of planetary motion in a binary star system — solving the gravitational three-body problem using numerical methods. The challenge involved computing stable and chaotic orbital trajectories of planets influenced by two gravitationally bound stars, implementing Runge-Kutta integration for accurate orbital mechanics.
