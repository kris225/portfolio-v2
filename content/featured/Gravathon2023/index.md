Project won VIT Vellore's Gravathon 2023. Built a simulation of planetary motion in a binary star system, solving the gravitational three-body problem using numerical methods. Implemented Runge-Kutta integration for accurate orbital mechanics, computing stable and chaotic trajectories influenced by two gravitationally bound stars.
